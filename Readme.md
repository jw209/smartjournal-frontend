# SmartJournal Mobile Application

## Getting Started

You need NPM, Yarn, the Expo CLI, and the Expo App (on your phone).

```sh
# after you installed NodeJS
$ npm i -g yarn expo-cli
```

Clone the repository and open a terminal in it.

```sh
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

This will display a QR code you can scan with the Expo App to start developing.
